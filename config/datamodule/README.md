# Data module configs

This directory contains some example data module configs for training. Note that these paths are not available publicly and serve as stand-ins. Please modify the paths to use filelists containing data you have access to. Any such .txt file should contain, on each line, a pair of filenames separated by ',' (see the 'pairs_delim' setting in the example configs.)

See also flowdec/data/data_module.py for details (esp. for mode 'paired_filelist') on how the filelist files are parsed.
